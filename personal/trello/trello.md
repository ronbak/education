# 4 TIPS FOR WORKING WITH TRELLO

## 1. One project = one board, no one MONSTER BOARD!
## 2. To Do, Doing and Done!
## 3. Label your labels.
When I’m working on web projects, here’s a scheme I use:

* Red: Blocker (we can’t launch until this is addressed)
* Orange: Annoying (technically this isn’t impeding core functionality, but not fixing it means annoying a lot of people)
* Yellow: Cosmetic (visual tweaks or minor UI improvements that are, if we’re being honest, mostly for my own peace of mind)
* Blue: Reference (data that I might want to come back to again later in the project)

A simple Low/Med/High system could work well, too. The idea is that when you label your labels, you add an extra layer of visual information that allows you to quickly gloss and prioritize across your entire project.

## 4. Get creative
There’s no wrong way to use Trello. That’s part of what makes it such a wonderful tool. With it, you could:

* Write a novel (stacks: Concept, Characters, Plot, Themes, Motifs, Recurring Motifs, Endings, Beginnings, and Research).
* Cut down on conference call lengths. Each person or team gets a stack, each card is an agenda item.
* Organize recipes (stacks: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Snacks).
* UX designers and product managers can keep track of user stories. Each stack could be dedicated to a theme or a specific use case for your project.
