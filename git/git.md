/_  Git has a 3 Tier Architecture:  Working - Staging - Repo Changes to files are put in a Checksum SHA-1 hash 40digit value containing parent hash, author and message. HEAD is the latest commit of the checked out branch _/

/_  Basic Commands  _/

git commit -m "" /_  Commits and changes to all files that are in Staging into Repo  _/

git diff /_  show changes between Working and Local Repo, no file supplied shows all files  _/

git diff --staged /_  shows changes between Staged and Local Repo  _/

git rm file.txt /_  will remove file from working then git commit -m "" to also remove from Repo _/

git rm --cached file.txt /_ leaves copy of file in Working but removes from Staging and Repo _/

git mv /_  rename or move files - then git commit -m "" to move to Repo _/

git commit -am "text goes here" /_ adds all files straight to Repo from Staging if they have changes - meaning they skip git add _/

git checkout -- file.txt /_  restore Repo file to Working Directory using current branch  _/

git reset --soft HEAD^ /_ restore repo file to staging _/

git reset HEAD file.txt /_  Move a Stage file out of Stage back to Working _/

git commit --amend -m "message" file.txt /_ Change last commit to Repo (only last one can change) _/

/_ Reverting --soft --mixed --hard will go back to previous commits_/ git log /_ gets the sha1s so you can see the coomits where you want revert  back to  _/

git reset --soft sha /_ changes Repo but not Staging or Working _/

git reset --mixed sha /_ changes Repo and Staging but not Working _/

git reset --hard sha /_ changes all 3 Tiers _/

git clean -f /_ remove untracked files from Working  _/

.gitignore /_ ignores files to track in Working / track the .gitignore file _/

git push -u origin master /_ push to remote(origin) and branch(master) /_ Cloning a GitHub Repo - create and get the URL of a new repository from GitHub, then clone that to your local repo, example below uses local repo named 'nameoffolder' */

git clone [https://github.com/neilgee/genesischild.git](https://github.com/neilgee/genesischild.git) nameoffolder
